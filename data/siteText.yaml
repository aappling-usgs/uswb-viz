explanationText1: |
   The [U.S. Geological Survey Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program](https://www.usgs.gov/science/mission-areas/water/groundwater-and-streamflow-information?qt-programs_l2_landing_page=0#qt-programs_l2_landing_page)
   is funded by Congress to monitor drought and flood across the US through a network of stream gages.
   
   Why should you care about USGS streamgages? The USGS has been monitoring streamflow since 1889, and data from streamgages
   have since become critical to hydropower operations, recreation, streamflow prediction, flood forecasts, emergency 
   management, engineering designs, and many other purposes.
